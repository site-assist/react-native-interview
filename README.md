# üèó SiteAssist React Native Exercise

## üëã Welcome! 

In this exercise we aim to understand how you would solve a simple problem. The goal of this is to see what you know and your experience level in React Native, your general coding style & practices
as well the way you approach the solving the task.

The assignment should take you 2-3 hours to complete. Don't worry about making it perfect, it's most important that you 
build something simple that works. If there are things you didn't have time for and you'd like to discuss please write them
in a .md file in your submission.

## Description

Design and implement a Calculator mobile application. Showcase as many different concepts
that you think would be useful to be in a modern complex mobile application.

This assignment should take no longer than 2 or 3 hours to complete

#### The functional requirements of this Calculator app are as follows:

1. Perform basic mathematical operations (addition and subtraction)
2. Input values and operations using on-screen buttons in a grid layout like the example below (please do feel free to add your own creative twist to make it a more enjoyable experience):

3. Store a history of mathematical operations with a screen that shows them in a list

#### The non-functional requirements of this Calculator app are as follows:

1. Use react-navigation as the navigation library
2. Use TypeScript
3. Use styled-components for styling. *We use Rebass type components for base styles using styled-system on top of styled-components in our production applications. Feel free to use these for even more convenient styling if you are comfortable. The base components are provided in the `src/fundamentals` directory*
4. Use redux to manage basic state. Feel free to use any other data storage solutions to supplement functionality if you wish
5. Other than the libraries mentioned above, feel free to use any other libraries you like. We are not looking for you to build everything.

#### Additionally, some nice additional requirements to consider adding would be:

1. Persist the Calculator history between app hard closes
2. Support operations on the answer to the previous calculation
3. Add multiplication and division support
4. If you think of any other creative features you think would be good to showcase, we would love to see ;)

Good luck and looking forward to seeing what you come up with!

#### Submission

To submit the assignment, please a tarball of the project to `tech-task-submissions@siteassist.co` 

You should also submit the .git folder so that we can get an idea of the history of your changes.

Please don't put this on GitHub so that other people doing the assignment can't find your code.

In addition to the code please add a .md file with anything you'd like to discuss further i.e. known issues, future improvements.

# react-native-interview

Welcome :)

To see if we can find some talking points to discuss in more detail with examples,
we would love you to complete a coding task. The goal of this is to see what
you know and your experience level in React Native, your general coding style & practices
as well the way you approach the solving the task

Your task is as follows:

## Description

Design and implement a Calculator mobile application. Showcase as many different concepts
that you think would be useful to be in a modern complex mobile application. Use any technologies/libraries you like.

This assignment should take no longer than 2 or 3 hours to complete

#### The functional requirements of this Calculator app are as follows:

1. Perform basic mathematical operations (addition and subtraction)
2. Input values and operations using on-screen buttons in a grid layout like the example below (please do feel free to add your own creative twist to make it a more enjoyable experience):

3. Store a history of mathematical operations with a screen that shows them in a list

#### The non-functional requirements of this Calculator app are as follows:

1. Use react-navigation as the navigation library
2. Use styled-components for styling. We use Rebass type components for base styles using styled-system on top of styled-components in our production applications. Feel free to use these for even more convenient styling if you are comfortable. The base components are provided in the `src/fundamentals` directory`
3. A thought out code/folder structure for extendable development
4. Follow best coding practices
5. Use redux to manage basic state. Feel free to use any other data storage solutions to supplement functionality if you wish

#### Additionally, some nice additional requirements to consider adding would be:

1. Persist the Calculator history between app hard closes
2. Support operations on the answer to the previous calculation
3. Add multiplication and division support
4. Use TypeScript
5. If you think of any other creative features you think would be good to showcase, we would love to see ;)

Good luck and looking forward to seeing what you come up with!
